# Noninvasive Acute Compartment Syndrome Diagnostic 

Code for a continuous, objective, noninvasive diagnostic for ACS. The device detects ACS through a random forest machine learning model that uses pressure readings from force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) placed on the skin. The final diagnosis is exported real-time to a web application via Bluetooth. 

Coded through TensorFlow Lite.

Web application connects to Arduino ESP32 via bluetooth.
